**Installation ** 

 All the urls to be crawled must be defined in :

	- Class task_html_txt.Main.java
		in variable urlPaths

The url to file mapping is located in file :
	
	- task_1\text_files\wikipedia\links.txt
	
	- the url and file name is seperated by a space, 
	    ( If you want to change that, you have to change the variable 
			'delimited' in class database.Parameters  )
